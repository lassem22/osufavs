# osufavs
A small python script to show if two people share favorited maps/mappers, and which ones. Additionally it will tell you, for each user, which mapper's maps they favorited the most.

A result could for example look like this:

# Requirements
- Python 3.8 (probably works fine on other versions too, but this is what I used)
-  [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) 
-  [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests//)  

If you don't have Python set up you can also simply run the script through an online service like [repl.it](https://repl.it/).

# Usage
- open osufavs.py
- change the values **u1_id** and **u2_id** to the UserIDs of the profiles you want to compare
